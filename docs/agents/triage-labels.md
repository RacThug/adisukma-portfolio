# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This file maps those roles to the
actual strings used in this repo's issue tracker.

This repo uses a local-markdown tracker, so there are no labels in the GitHub sense. A
"label" here is the value of the `Status:` line near the top of an issue file under
`.scratch/`. See `issue-tracker.md`.

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Status value in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`             | `needs-triage`              | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`               | `needs-info`                | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`          | `ready-for-agent`           | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human`          | `ready-for-human`           | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`                  | `wontfix`                   | Will not be actioned                     |

When a skill mentions a role (for example "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), write the
corresponding string from this table into the issue file's `Status:` line.

Edit the right-hand column to match whatever vocabulary you actually use.
